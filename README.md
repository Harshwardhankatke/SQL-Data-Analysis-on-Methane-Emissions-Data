# SQL-Data-Analysis-on-Methane-Emissions-Data
# Project Overview:
This project involves analyzing a dataset of methane emissions using MySQL and Python. The goal is to explore methane emission patterns, uncover trends, and provide insights for environmental applications. The dataset, "Methane_final.csv," includes key data points such as emission levels, geographical information, and timestamps.

# Objectives:

# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
 Clean the dataset by handling missing values, correcting data inconsistencies, and formatting it for further analysis.

Use Python libraries like pandas to preprocess and prepare the data for analysis.
# SQL Data Analysis:
 Utilize MySQL Workbench to execute SQL queries to extract valuable insights, including calculating average methane levels, identifying emission trends over time, and comparing emissions across different regions.

Write complex SQL queries, leveraging JOINs, GROUP BY, and HAVING to manipulate and filter data for deeper analysis.
# Data Visualization:
 Use Python libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas to create clear and informative visualizations of the data.

Create visual representations such as bar charts, line plots, scatter plots, and time series graphs to showcase the findings from SQL queries.
# Insight Generation & Reporting:
 Analyze the visualized data and compile key insights into a comprehensive report.

Make data-driven recommendations for mitigating methane emissions based on the analysis.
# Tools Used:
 MySQL Workbench for data querying and manipulation

Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, SQL connector) for data visualization and analysis
